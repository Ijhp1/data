He wandered until he found the witch's cottage, but stumbled back in fright as soon as he caught sight of her absorbed in her forging, a devilish smile twisting her lips. The witch looked up at the sound, pinning him with her eyes, and the boy panicked. In his terror, he shoved her, hoping to escape, and she dropped the hammer in her surprise. Scrambling, the boy lunged to pick it up before she could."
